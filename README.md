A2D2 iOS
========
iOS repository for Airmen Against Drunk Driving application.

## Our Purpose
The Airmen Against Drunk Driving program was established to provide Airmen with a safe and reliable mode of transportation after a night of drinking. When BESPIN was tasked with creating the A2D2 application, we also took this burden upon ourselves to keep our Airmen safe and moved it to the mobile domain. The A2D2 app functions much like other ride request services. Airmen can request a ride, from within a certain radius to base, for them and their group to return home safe.
